My portfolio website

This is a portfolio web app to showcase my personal developer experience in a brief and convenient layout. Originally as a way to reinforce my skills in React, I have also learned a lot about optimizing website development, such as using tailwind to help with the styling and lazy loading to improve the speed of animations. 

This site was hosted through a CI/CD pipeline on Netlify, which can be found [here](https://marissa4mae.netlify.app/)https://marissa4mae.netlify.app/) 
However just in case, here are a couple of screenshots if the site gets taken down.
