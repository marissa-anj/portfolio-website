            Throughout my academic career, I have had the privilege of working with enterprise-level clients, which has allowed me to gain experience as a database developer, data analyst, and web developer. I am passionate about specializing in the development, delivery, and performance of data-driven solutions. My background includes creating and launching websites, and I am currently expanding my skills by learning about AWS and tinkering with TensorFlow. In my free time you can find me cafe-hopping. I also love to draw!
